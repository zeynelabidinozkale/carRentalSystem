The Car Rental System Project is a web-based application in which all car rental processes are implemented. The software-based or manual systems used by local car rental businesses are difficult and not useful for many reasons. It takes time for customers and staff to find out which vehicle is available for booking. It is very costly in terms of data usage, time, and effort to carry out the registration, deletion, and keeping vehicle fleet stock information up to date operations of the vehicles separately for each office. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a more flexible and distributed system for the needs of customers and staff. The project aims to make daily transactions in car rental systems much easier. For this purpose, dynamic role and vehicle fleet registration are designed and used in this project to make the database and database operations more efficient and less costly.
